        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        A HID (Human Interface Device) is a type of device that takes input
        from or provides output to humans. It also refers to the HID protocol,
        a standard for bi-directional communication between a host and a device
        that is designed to simplify the installation procedure. The HID
        protocol was originally developed for USB devices but has since been
        implemented over many other protocols, including Bluetooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web platform already supports input from many HID devices.
        Keyboards, pointing devices, and gamepads are all typically implemented
        using the HID protocol. However, this support relies on the operating
        system's HID drivers that transform the HID input into high-level input
        APIs. Devices that are not well supported by the host's HID driver are
        often inaccessible to web pages. Similarly, the outputs on most devices
        that are not supported by the host's HID driver are inaccessible.

        Motivating Applications

        <h3>
          Niche devices
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most common classes of HID input devices are already
          well-supported on the web platform through existing high-level input
          APIs. For instance, mouse input is accessible through the
          PointerEvent API and keyboard input is accessible through the
          Keyboard API. Input from these devices is handled using the host's
          native HID driver and typically does not require device-specific
          drivers or configuration to work correctly. WebHID is not intended
          for devices like these that are already well-supported through
          high-level input APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some classes of HID devices, the web platform supports some
          features of the device but limits access to other features. For
          instance, the Gamepad API supports the input capabilities of most
          game controllers but does not support less common capabilities like
          LED indicators or audio. These features are often not well-supported
          by host APIs and adding support within the user agent can lead to
          significant complexity. WebHID would give applications an alternative
          when the functionality provided by the high-level API is incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many HID devices are not supported through any web platform API. The
          HID specification describes a wide array of devices that could be
          supported through HID, including virtual reality controls, flight
          simulators, medical equipment, and more. WebHID would allow these
          devices to be used without requiring additional drivers or
          modification to the user agent.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Prototyping, hobbyists, and educational devices
        </h3>
        <p>
          HID is attractive for prototyping and hobbyist applications because
          it allows devices to use the host's generic HID driver instead of
          requiring a driver for each host where the device will be used. The
          simplified installation procedure also makes it easier for educators
          to deploy a device to a classroom of students without modifying the
          system configuration on each host. Providing access to HID devices
          through the web platform would further reduce installation
          requirements, particularly for devices that are currently only
          supported through host-specific applications.

        <h3>
          Abusing Access to a Device
        </h3>
        <p>
          HID peripherals may expose powerful functionality that should not be
          made accessible to the page without explicit consent from the user.
          For instance, a HID peripheral may have sensors that allow it to
          collect information about its surroundings. A device may store
          private information that should not be revealed or overwritten. Many
          devices expose functionality that allow the device firmware to be
          upgraded. Operating systems typically do not restrict access to HID
          devices from applications, and this access can occasionally be abused
          to damage the device or corrupt the data stored on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, a device may expose functionality that should not be
          accessible at all from a web page. Specific devices may be blocked by
          recognizing the device by its vendor and product ID and hiding such
          devices during enumeration. The HID report descriptor allows a device
          to describe its own capabilities, and this information can be used to
          block classes of devices even when the vendor and product ID cannot
          be known in advance. This can be accomplished by inspecting the usage
          values assigned to collections within the report descriptor; for
          instance, access to keyboard-like devices can be denied by denying
          access to devices that include a top-level collection with the
          Keyboard usage ID.
        </p>
        <p>
          To mitigate abuse, a device will not be made available to the page
          until the user has granted explicit access. Access must first be
          requested by the page and will be granted once the user has selected
          the device from a chooser displaying all available devices. Once a
          page has been granted access, an indicator will be displayed to
          indicate the device is in use.

        <h3>
          Attacking a Device
        </h3>
        <p>
          The HID protocol is extremely versatile, and a wide variety of
          devices have been designed that take advantage of this versatility.
          As a result, there are many possibilities for how access to a device
          could allow a malicious page to damage the device itself. It is
          relatively common for HID peripherals to allow firmware updates to be
          sent using custom HID reports. Device manufacturers must take care to
          design the firmware upgrade mechanism to verify that the firmware
          binary is authentic, and should also protect against downgrades that
          could reduce the security of a device. Untrusted upgrades could be
          used to add new capabilities to a device or cause it to masquerade as
          an entirely different type of device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some devices may be damaged when inputs are provided outside of the
          expected range. For instance, the rumble feature on a gamepad could
          become damaged if a page sends an invalid rumble command.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, these types of attacks are device-specific and cannot be
          mitigated at the API level.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='attacking-the-host'>
        <h3>
          Attacking the Host
        </h3>
        <p>
          If a malicious page gains access to a device, in some cases this
          access can be used to attack the host. A major concern is whether the
          device can be used to generate trusted input events. These events
          serve as a proxy for user intent and can be used to access more
          powerful web platform features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mice and keyboards are typically implemented as HID peripherals, and
          are also capable of generating trusted input. A HID keyboard or mouse
          may contain advanced features like programmable macros, which store a
          sequence of inputs and allow the sequence to be played back at a
          later time. Device manufacturers must take care to design such
          features in a way that would prevent a malicious app from
          reprogramming the device with an unexpected input sequence, and must
          also protect against triggering macro playback without the user's
          explicit consent.

        <h3>
          Mitigation
        </h3>
        <p>
          To mitigate security and privacy risks, it is recommended that
          user agents implement a chooser-based flow for requesting device
          access. When a page requests access to a HID device, the user
          agent should display a dialog that informs the user that the
          page wants to access a device. The dialog should display a list
          of connected HID devices and ask the user to select a device
          that will be exposed to the page. To reduce the possibility of
          accidental clicks, the dialog should require two separate
          interactions: one interaction to select the device from the list
          and a second interaction to confirm the selection and dismiss
          the dialog.
